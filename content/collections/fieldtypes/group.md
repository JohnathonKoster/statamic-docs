## Overview

A group fieldtype is a simple container that holds additional fields you would like grouped visually as well as under a parent key.

## Data Storage

In the screenshot above, the data structure for these fields will be as follows:

```yaml
location:
  address: 123 Main Street
  city: Schenectady
  zip: 12345
```


## Templating

All fields inside a Group will be scoped under their parent key like so:

::tabs

::tab antlers

```antlers
{{ location:address }}, {{ location:city }}, {{ location:zip }}
```

::tab blade
```blade
{{ $location['address'] }}, {{ $location['city'] }}, {{ $location['zip'] }}
```
::

will output

```html
123 Main Street, Schenectady, 1234
```
